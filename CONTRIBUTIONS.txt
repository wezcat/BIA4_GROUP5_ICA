CONTRIBUTIONS

Chen Ruihan: Implemented and debugged the software, code modularization, designed CNN and EfficientNet-B0, benchmarked part of the models.

Qiu Zhichen: Develop an EfficientNet-B0 + XGBoost model, discarding a low-accuracy KNN alternative. Generate Grad-CAM visualizations for different models.

Zhu Taoyu: Develop a feature extraction and generation technique for machine learning models, develop and train DenseNet, develop a deep learning-machine learning mixed model. 

Wu Di: Benchmarked models and generated the benchmarking figure, developed the SVM and Random Forest models.

Shi Zhongyu: Developed Vgg16 and ViT models. 

Zhang Linfeng: Developed supervised deep learning models InceptionV3 and ResNet34. 

Fang Ruihan: Developed unet and resnet50 models. Create the framework of GUI, integrate and register the alignment model interface into our GUI.
